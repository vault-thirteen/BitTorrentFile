# BitTorrentFile

A library to work with the _BitTorrent_ file format.

## Description

This library allows to parse _BitTorrent_ files using the _BitTorrent_ 
specification of versions 1 and 2.

The _BitTorrent_ file format was introduced with the appearance of the 
_BitTorrent_ protocol. 

This format is as weird and as stupid as the _BitTorrent_ protocol and the 
_bencode_ encoding.

More information about the _BitTorrent_ can be found on its website:
https://www.bittorrent.org/.
